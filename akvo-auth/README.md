## Working with the code

To run the code in this repository you must have a recent Java JRE or JDK installed.

Get it [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

Java 7 is preferred.

In addition to a working JVM, you will need the [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) command line tool installed somewhere on your `$PATH`.

Once Leiningen is installed, you should be able to run `lein version` from the command line and see output something like the following:

    Leiningen 2.2.0 on Java 1.7.0_25 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM

## What about tests?

Run the following command to run the tests manually:

    lein test
